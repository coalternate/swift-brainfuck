# Swift Brainfuck Interpreter

In the name, 'innit? A brainfuck interpreter written in Swift.

Seriously though, this project is huge. Lotta customizeability. Under heavy construction.

Can currently interpret any brainfuck program, though usage and installation instructions won't be made available until version 1.0 release.

Currently working on the executable side of things, making small library tweaks here and there.
